# CS50-Editor
My CS50 final project, a web editor 

This is my project based on CS50 pset7 where I have 2 editors, one for programming and the other for writing down notes.
I plan to add more features over time

This is written in PHP, javascript, CSS and html. I used php for apache and mysql to handle login details
